# 🔧 Capacitor Node.js Version Fix

## The Error

```
error @capacitor/cli@7.4.3: The engine "node" is incompatible with this module. 
Expected version ">=20.0.0". Got "18.20.8"
```

## ✅ Problem Solved

**Issue**: Capacitor CLI v7.4.3 requires Node.js 20+ but GitHub Actions was using Node.js 18.

**Solution**: Updated all GitHub Actions workflows to use Node.js 20.

## 🚀 What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated Main Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/android-build.yml`
```yaml
# BEFORE
node-version: '18'

# AFTER  
node-version: '20'
```

### 2. Updated Simple Workflow  
**File**: `.github/workflows/android-build-simple.yml`
```yaml
# BEFORE
node-version: '18'

# AFTER
node-version: '20' 
```

## 🎯 Ready to Test

Your workflows should now run successfully with Node.js 20:

### Option 1: Simple Test
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to Actions → "Simple Android Build"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. ✅ Should complete without Node.js version errors

### Option 2: Full Pipeline
1. Go to Actions → "Build Baby Steps Android App" 
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select "bundle" as build type
4. ✅ Should generate .aab file successfully

## 🔍 Why Node.js 20?

- **Capacitor 7.x**: Requires Node.js 20+ for modern JavaScript features
- **Node.js 20**: Current LTS version with best performance
- **GitHub Actions**: Fully supports Node.js 20
- **Future Proof**: Ensures compatibility with latest tools

## 📦 Expected Results

After this fix, your build should:
- ✅ Install dependencies without version errors
- ✅ Build React app successfully  
- ✅ Sync Capacitor without issues
- ✅ Generate .aab file for Google Play Console

## 🆘 If Still Issues

If you encounter other errors after this fix:

1. **Clear Cache**: Add this step to workflow
```yaml
- name: Clear Yarn Cache
  run: yarn cache clean
```

2. **Update Dependencies**: Run locally
```bash
cd frontend
yarn upgrade
```

3. **Check Logs**: Look at specific build step that fails

The Node.js version compatibility issue is now resolved! 🎉
