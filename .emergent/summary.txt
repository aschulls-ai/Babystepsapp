The AI engineer's trajectory details extensive development on the Baby Steps application. Initial efforts focused on addressing mobile build issues and integrating Google AdSense. Subsequent work included simplifying the dashboard, adding baby profile editing, and introducing a formula comparison feature. Key tasks completed involved adding AI response time notices to various search components (FoodResearch, FormulaComparison, MealPlanner, Research), incorporating Kendamil formulas, developing an interactive Emergency Training slideshow, and fixing a missing backend PUT endpoint for baby profile updates. The engineer also integrated Vercel Speed Insights, added an AdSense banner to the login page, and implemented a robust reminder system with quick action buttons on the Tracking page. Crucially, Vercel deployment issues were resolved by migrating the backend to Vercel API routes. The last active phase involved fixing new user registration, search bar functionality on Vercel, and enhancing quick action buttons with timers and custom icons. The current activity is debugging multiple reported bugs, specifically addressing the meal planner search bar and potentially the baby profile editor.

<product_requirements>
The Baby Steps app serves as a comprehensive parenting tool for baby tracking (measurements, milestones, feeding, sleep), nutrition/safety guidance (AI-powered food research, emergency training), and includes user authentication. Recent updates focused on converting the web app to a native Android app via Capacitor, integrating Google AdSense for monetization, simplifying the dashboard, enabling full baby profile editing, displaying current milestones, and implementing a detailed baby formula comparison feature (including Kendamil formulas). The app also provides AI response time notices in search features, an interactive emergency training slideshow with original infant/toddler content, a persistent login remember me option, and an enhanced tracking activities page with simplified buttons, customizable quick actions (e.g., timed naps, pumping with left/right breast milk amounts), and a robust reminder system with notifications. A comprehensive activity log with filtering and sorting was added, and the app is designed for native Vercel deployment using API routes.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database, with Capacitor for mobile conversion. The recent Vercel deployment strategy involves serverless API routes within the React frontend for backend logic.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Login endpoint allows login without email verification. Modified to add PUT/DELETE endpoints for , and a PUT endpoint for  for profile updates. Also includes models and endpoints for various tracking activities and AI research.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Consolidated Axios configuration, integrated AdSense and Vercel Speed Insights. Contains , , ,  functions, and defines application routes. Modified to handle  and API error handling.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AuthPage.js**: Handles user login, registration, and password reset. Modified to include a Remember Me checkbox for persistent login and integrated  at the bottom.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js**: Simplified dashboard with quick shortcuts and current milestones.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/BabyProfile.js**: Allows full editing of baby profiles. Changes made for date handling and to call the correct API endpoint.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/TrackingPage.js**: Core component for tracking activities. Heavily refactored to include simplified quick action buttons with customizable modals (e.g., , ), a comprehensive reminder system, and a sortable Activity History log. Icons for quick actions were updated.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Research.js**: AI chat interface. Modified to include AI response time notice and  import.

-   **/app/frontend/public/index.html**: Integrated Google AdSense script.
-   **/app/vercel.json**: Configuration for Vercel deployment, updated to include Vercel API routes.
-   **/app/frontend/api/\***: New directory for Vercel native API routes. These Node.js files (e.g., , , ) act as serverless functions, proxying or replicating backend logic directly on Vercel to resolve cross-origin issues. Includes local in-memory storage simulation for user data persistence across ephemeral function calls.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing multiple user-reported bugs. The first bug was that the baby profile editor will not save any updates. The engineer investigated this, confirming the  function in  and the  in  were correct, but found a potential date formatting issue in the  Vercel API route, which was then fixed to handle date objects correctly.

The engineer then moved on to the second reported bug: The meal planner search bar does not work, an error message of failed. The engineer identified the root cause as a mismatch in the API endpoint being called by the frontend () versus the actual Vercel API route that was created (). The engineer has just started to implement the fix for this issue by correcting the endpoint path.

The trajectory ends at the point of fixing the meal planner search bar error.
